This program depends on libspotify. Download it from here:
   'https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#download'.

You may encouter problems when building saying something like this:
   Package libspotify was not found in the pkg-config search path.
   Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libspotify.pc'
   to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
   No package 'libspotify' found

it also requrire libasound. (libasound2-dev is the package name on debaian/ubuntu).

If you installed libspotify without any parameters, the location of the package should be:
   '/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/libspotify.pc'

The following bash-command will enable your system to finding the package:
   'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/'

Alterativly, if for example you dont have root access and installed libspotify somewhere in your homefolder,you have to give that path instead. Lets say you installed it to a folder named local under your homefolder.
   'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig/' 

You may also have to this, if you installed outside of root-directory, again this example is local in the homefolder:
   'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib'
